  About me
</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am a research intern at Synergy Labs (Carnegie Mellon University) with an undergraduate degree in Information Technology. Currently, my research interests include Applied Machine Learning, Mobile Health, Systems and Sensing technologies that have profound impact on society. During my undergraduation, I explored a range of research topics in ML, which lead to publications in international conferences. Apart from this, I love playing sport, cricket being my favorite, and enjoy listening to music. Feel free to email me if you would like to connect.
