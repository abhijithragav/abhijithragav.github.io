  About me
</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	I am a CS Grad Student at Georgia Tech specializing in Machine Learning. 
	research intern at Synergy Labs (Carnegie Mellon University) with an undergraduate degree in Information Technology. Currently, my research interest involves developing ubiquitous, accessible, and unobtrusive health solutions that have a profound impact on people, leveraging the latest advancements in AI and novel sensing technologies. During my undergraduation, I worked on solutions for bettering mental health using physiological signals, which lead to publications in international conferences. I did my undergrad thesis at CMU, where I worked on Apart from this, I love playing sport, cricket being my favourite, and enjoy listening to music. Feel free to email me if you would like to connect.</p>
